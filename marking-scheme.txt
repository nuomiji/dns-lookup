Total before late penalty: [/63]

NOTE: in the marking report something left blank (e.g.  [ /6]) typically means
that you received full marks for that item.  There will be a mark deduction of 10 points if, 
for any reason, your program fails to compile on the undergraduate machines.

Milestones marks will be added to total.  

General Functionality: [/40]

   [/2] Basic query to a name server that is authoritative.

    (e.g. www.cs.ubc.ca to 198.162.35.1)

   [/5] Basic Query that starts at root server and works to an

        authoritative server in a straightforward path.

        (e.g. www.cs.ubc.ca to a root name server)

   [/5] A basic type query that results in a CNAME and the need to

        restart the search for the alias. (e.g. prep.ai.mit.edu)

   [/3] A query that returns a name server to use where the name

        server's address isn't provided. (e.g. www.stanford.edu)

   [/3] A complicated lookup series that potentially involves multiple

        cnames and DNS server name lookups (finance.google.ca)

   [/3] Can deal with information in the additional information

        section when not all of it is of interest/use

        (e.g. groups.yahoo.com)

   [/3] Can deal with unconventional but valid response records

        (e.g. uncompressed RR names, compression of the query name).

   [/3] Adds all resource records in the additional section to the cache.

   [/2] Uses cached data when available (for a regular query).

   [/3] Uses cached data when available (for a CNAME query).

   [/2] The TTL reported is the last TTL from the A (or AAAA) record 

        when a CNAME is involved.

   [/2] Uses IPv4 nameserver even when IPv6 request is done.

   [/2] If a query returns more than IP address all IP addresses

        are printed.

   [/2] Is able to properly request and parse A, AAAA, NS and CNAME

        records.

Error Handling: [/8]

   [/2] Timeout - nameserver doesn't respond

   [/2] Too many queries (e.g. loop1.csproject.org)

   [/2] Name does not resolve (e.g. wee.cs.ubc.ca)

   [/2] Other types of errors (e.g. just do a lookup of  .ca)

Tracing: [/9]

  [/1] Prints query ID, server being queried and FQDN

  [/1] Query ID is different for every query during a run

  [/1] Prints Response ID line, with query ID and whether or not this

       is an authoritative response

  [/1] Prints the counts for the Answers, Namservers, and Additional

       Information fields.


  Printing of the Response Records

  [/1] Prints A in proper format

  [/1] Prints AAAA  in proper format

  [/1] Prints CNAMES in proper format

  [/1] Prints NS in proper format

  [/1] Prints type number if not in above
